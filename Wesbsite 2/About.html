				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p><strong>Nepal adopted the multi-university concept in 1983. The idea of Pokhara University (PU) was conceived in 1986; however, it was established only in 1997 under the Pokhara University Act, 1997. The Incumbent Honorable Prime Minister and the Honorable Minister for Education of the Federal Democratic Republic Nepal are the Chancellor and the Pro-Chancellor, respectively.  The Chancellor appoints the Vice Chancellor, the principal executive officer of the university. The Registrar is designated to assist him/her in financial management and general administration. A non-profit autonomous institution, PU is partly funded by the Government of Nepal and partly by revenues from its students and affiliated colleges.</strong>
